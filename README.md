# AnimationTree Jump Example
Example of using AnimationTree to squat and jump

If you load it up, just hold space to charge up the jump and release _to_ jump. It's not pretty but it demonstrates an effective blender-godot-animation tree pipeline for achieving blended animations controlled through code!

Code is handled in the PERSON.tscn root node's script person.gd
